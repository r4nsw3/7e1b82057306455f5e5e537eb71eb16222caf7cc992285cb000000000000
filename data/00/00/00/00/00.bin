  |   The story takes place in the development offices of a software        |
  |   company, ""Awesome Rainbow Corp"". Trouble arises just as you're      |
  |   gearing up to release the final version of the game! Many             |

  |   To deal with this situation, a programmer, Stella, whips up a debug   |
